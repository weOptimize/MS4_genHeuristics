PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND
This project aims to create the necessary socioecological conditions for Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx in a transboundary area south of the Douro River that both species are starting to recolonize. Improving ecological conditions will include increasing abundance of wild prey and improving habitat. Improving social conditions will include promoting positive coexistence with rural communities and socioeconomic local development, as well as increasing capacity and knowledge exchange in the assessment of damage prevention and the detection of environmental crime.
