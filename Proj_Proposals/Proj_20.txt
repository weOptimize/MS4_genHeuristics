PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND
Over the past century, the prevailing Western economic system has created enormous wealth. However, profit maximisation came with social tensions (uneven income distribution), climate change and natural capital risks. Meanwhile, many different approaches to considering economic, social and environmental impacts have been developed, but they have yet to be broadly implemented. Companies are still managed based on accounting principles and concepts codified before the 1970s.


OBJECTIVES
The TRANSPARENT project aims to:

Develop a standard for the evaluation of economic, ecological and social impact (which can be applied at a company, process and product level);
Standardise how to assess and monetise the value of a company and its (financial and pre-financial) contributions to society (environmental and social impacts and dependencies);
Understand the interdependencies of value contribution to society and their relation to enterprise value;
Design a disclosure a format enabling stakeholders to compare the natural, social, human and financial capital performance across companies (integrated profit and loss, and the balance sheet);
Develop a management blueprint for multi-capital-based business steering, and test its use in management accounting; and
Spread the ‘impact measurement and valuation’ (IMV) by publishing the results and ensure maintenance of data and further development in respective organisations.

RESULTS
Expected results: The main outcome will be a standardised system for corporate environmental and social accounting.

This system will lead to:

Reduced transaction costs for (environmental and social) impact assessment of business activities;
Increased comparability of valuation and impact assessment results across a wide range of sectors and companies;
Increased use of corporate environmental accounting;
Improved corporate solutions for managing natural capital and steps towards a circular economy;
Business decisions based on better information regarding the overall impact; and
Improved natural capital and recirculation of materials in the long term.
