PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND
The European wine industry produces 28 million tonnes of grapes annually and nearly 5.6 million tonnes of grape pomaces. Around 40% of this output is considered as low-value waste (e.g. fertiliser or fuel) although grape seeds are typically rich in valuable proteins. Indeed, the proteins extracted from grape seeds (EPV) can be used in a key phase of the winemaking process known as clarification â€“ i.e. the removal of insoluble matter suspended in the wine before bottling.

 


OBJECTIVES
The project SEEDSPRO2WINE aims to implement a circular business model based on an industrial process for extracting proteins from de-tannificated grapes to be used as a fining agent in the wine industry.

Specifically, the project aims to:

Reintroduce winemaking residues, currently used as organic soil compost and burned as energy, into the winemaking production process as a fining agent that removes undesirable elements from wine; and
Replace the commonly used protein of animal origin (which has a high environmental footprint) and protein extracts from crops such as pea and potato with a plant-based protein for the clarification of wines.

RESULTS
Expected results:

Development of an EPV extraction plant (TRL8) and of a related business model.
Extraction of 35 tonnes of EPV from grape seeds.
Treatment of 675 tonnes of post-wining residues.
Reduction of CO2 emissions by around 384-1200 kg/year by project end and by 1920-6000 kg of CO2/year five years after its conclusion.
Certification of the EPV process according to the standards of International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV).
Engagement of 200 European stakeholders in the wine sector in replication activities.
