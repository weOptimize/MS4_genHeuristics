PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND
The current conservation status of habitats in the Atlantic Biogeographical Region (ABR) of Wallonia is particularly worrying due to the high concentration of human activities on this territory (intensive agriculture, urbanisation, etc.). These activities have gradually degraded natural areas of biological interest, which, for the most part, no longer exist except in the form of small isolated pockets in a largely impoverished landscape which is subject to significant anthropogenic pressures. This context poses a particular challenge for the implementation of Natura 2000 (N2000) in the region. The priority here is thus the restoration and protection of habitats within N2000 sites. However, to make them ecologically viable in the long term, it is essential to restore, reconnect and protect the isolated fragments of habitats still located outside the N2000 sites. To respond to these priorities, the LIFE AtlanticValleys considers Wallonia's ABR valleys as a single integrated ecosystem, targeting habitats ranging from transition biotopes located at the top of the catchment area to wetlands where water accumulates. This project will build on the knowledge generated by the LIFE BNIP (2015-2022) and implement some of its action and management plans. The project targets 16 N2000 sites in the Brabant and Hainaut valleys, and, in a logic of reconnection, also gives itself the possibility of intervening within a 10 km radius of these sites. More specifically, the project aims to restore 230 ha of habitats of community interest (2330, 3150, 4030, 6230*, 6410, 6430, 6510, 9190, 91E0*) and habitats favourable to species of community interest (reed beds, ponds, wet and flood-prone meadows), create 100 ha of new protected areas, set up an initiative which encourages landowners located close to the restored sites to implement biodiversity friendly practices on their green spaces, strengthen Triturus cristatus populations, share project results as well as raise public awareness.
