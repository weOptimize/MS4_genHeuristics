PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BACKGROUND
Forests are an essential factor if the EU is to reach its climate goals. Forest management is the main means to improve their ecosystem services, as well as to increase their resilience to climate change. These objectives can be specifically reached by increasing the carbon stocks of forests, and reducing the impacts of the supply chain for wood products through the development of incentives and credit trading schemes for companies in the wood sector.


OBJECTIVES
The main goals of the LIFECO2PES&PEF project are to:

Analyse the ecosystem services of three forest areas located in the Alpine and Tosco-Emiliano Apennines regions in Italy;
Create a system for certification of credits linked to forest ecosystem services;
Evaluate the entire lifecycle of the wood industry, in accordance with the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) methodology, to minimise the industrys environmental impacts; and
Support policymakers in improving forest management through the Rural Development Funds, as well as to promote the use of wood for energy use.
In this way, the project will contribute to the implementation of the following EU policies: Forest Strategy: for forests and the forest-based sector (COM(2013) 659 final); Adaptation Strategy, by increasing the resilience of forests to climate change; LULUCF Regulation (2018/841/EU); Commission Recommendation 2013/179/EU; and the Habitats Directive (1992/43/EEC).


RESULTS
Expected results:

The improvement of CO2 absorption through the development of ecosystem services: the goal is an average value of 1.5-2 CO2 ton per hectare in each of the three selected areas;
The improvement of the risk assessment of hydrogeological damages, water management and fire risk prevention in the three areas;
A toolkit for companies in the wood sector to help them calculate their ecological footprint and prepare operational plans to reduce their impacts;
A certification standard for the ecosystem services provided by forests;
A credit trading platform for ecosystem credits;
Procedures to include ecosystem credits in the Green Bonds system;
Guidelines for policy stakeholders of the involved regions to support the use of wood for energy purposes, according to an energy cascade methodology;
Annual reduction of emissions of the wood supply chains by at least 0.42 kg (namely 2%) per cubic metre of wood production; and
Increased jobs related to forest activities, certifications, as well as credits management and financial activities linked to Green Bonds and green tourism.
